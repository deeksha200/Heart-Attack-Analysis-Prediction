# Heart-Attack-Analysis-Prediction
In this dataset I have performed data analysis which helped me to find the realtionships between different variables and how they contribute in heart attack cases.
Later I have also predicted What things to avoid to be at lower risk of heart attacks.
And I have build machine learning models which helps to predict which type of people at higher risk and which are not.
